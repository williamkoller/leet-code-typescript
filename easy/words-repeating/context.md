# The prefix function is used to find the largest common prefix between a set of words in an array of strings.

How it works:
Initial check: If the array is empty or contains only one word, it returns that word or an empty string.
Character-by-character iteration: Iterates through the characters of the first word and checks if all the elements of the array have that character in the same position.
Returning the common prefix: When it finds a character that is not the same in all words, it returns the prefix formed up to that point. Examples:
prefix(['flower', 'flow', 'flight']) → "fl"
prefix(['dog', 'racecar', 'car']) → "" (no common prefix)
prefix(['abc', 'abc', 'abc']) → "abc"
prefix(['abc', 'abcde', 'xyz']) → "" (no common prefix)
This function is useful for string manipulation problems, such as in word suggestion systems or pattern analysis.
