# Palindrome

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backwards and forwards, disregarding spaces, accents, and punctuation.

Examples of palindromes:
Words: "ovo", "arara", "radar"
Phrases: "A base do teto desabada", "Sacor-me, cimai no ônibus em Marrocos"
Numbers: 121, 4884, 1001
What does a palindrome need to do?
Have symmetry → The first half must be the same as the second half inverted.
Ignore case → "Arara" and "arara" are the same palindrome.
Ignore spaces and punctuation (if it is a phrase).
